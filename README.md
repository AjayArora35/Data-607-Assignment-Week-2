# Data-607-Assignment-Week-2
# Please read me:  
# 1.   The SQL Script assumes that you have installed MYSQL server >= 5.7.27 and workbench on your computer.
# 2.   Please run the SQL script first named: AjayMovieDBScript.SQL.
# 3.   The SQL script will create a database named: AjayMovies
# 4.   The SQL script will create two tables named: Movies and MovieRanking
# 5.   The SQL script will create a user named: ajmovieuser without a password (by design) who only has access to the AjayMovies.
# 6.   The SQL script will also populate the 2 tables with data.
# 7.   If you execute the script multiple times, the database and user are automatically removed and recreated.  
# 8.   Now, you can execute the RMD file named: Data 607 Assignment Week 2.  This will connect to AjayMovies database and retrieve records and display.
